8.	Console.Writeline(“42” + “1”);
9.	a method called Int32.Parse that you can use to convert a string value to an integer if you need to perform arithmetic computations on values held as strings.
10.	Precedence is the order of operations, and associativity is the direction that executes equation from left to right
11.	Cant use an unassigned variable
